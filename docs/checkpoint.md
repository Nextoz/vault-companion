# Checkpoint — 2026-09-25 (Phase 1, services integrated)

**HEAD:** `main` (clean after this commit). **Tests:** lint + typecheck + 305 tests / 20 files green;
Playwright WebKit 7/7 green at `86ef426` (web unchanged since).

**Completed since last checkpoint:** command services hardened at the kernel seam (`checkNoteInput`,
`KernelInvariantError` ⇒ non-retryable refusal); seam tests covering A1, A3–A5, A7, A10–A14, A17, A26–A28, A30,
A38, capture golden (ADR-0010) and lost-response retries for every command; InMemoryStore CAS made atomic.

**Remaining in Phase 1:** `docs/plan.md` → Work in progress items 3–4.

**Branches/worktrees:** `agent/markdown-kernel`, `agent/frontend-shell` merged; worktrees kept until the Phase 1
review. Herdr workers `kernel` (`w3:p4`), `frontend` (`w3:p3`) idle.

**Risks:** `docs/plan.md` → Unresolved issues / risks.

**Exact next action:** create `apps/worker/src/index.ts` (Workers entry: env bindings → Access verifier +
GitHubContentsStore + createCommandService → createApp) and `apps/worker/src/node.ts` (Node server over
LocalGitStore with a dev verifier) for Phase 2.
